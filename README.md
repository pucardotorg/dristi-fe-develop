# Pucar Dristi 2.0

PUCAR's DRISTI platform for NI Act §138 (cheque-dishonour) cases through Indian courts —
shared national core, deployed per state.

This repository holds product orientation docs and the main app shell. UI look and feel
comes from [pucar-design-system](https://github.com/pucardotorg/dristi-design-system) —
fetched automatically into `vendor/` on install; this repo does not fork it.

## Get started

```bash
git clone <this-repo>
cd <this-repo>
npm install          # also fetches the design system into vendor/
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

No sibling clones, no home-path config. `npm install` places the authoritative DS at
`vendor/pucar-design-system` (`pucardotorg` only) and refuses wrong-org trees.

## Branches

Three long-lived branches on `pucardotorg/dristi-fe`: `main` (default, dev team),
`design` (design team), `develop` (dev team). Nothing lands on them except through a PR;
PRs into `design` need the design owner's approval.

```bash
git checkout -b feature/<kebab-case> origin/design   # design work
```

## Layout

| `.cursor/skills/`, `.claude/skills/` | On-demand skills |

## UI sync

```bash
npm run sync:ui -- button      # copy a primitive from vendor DS
npm run check:ui-sync          # primitives must match that DS
npm run check:spacing          # spacing stays on the ladder
```
