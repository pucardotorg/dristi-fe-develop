/**
 * `/employee/cases` — the register. The rail's "All cases" row leads here, and so does
 * every tile on the dashboard, carrying its category in `?priority=`.
 *
 * The title comes from `COURT_CASES_PAGE` rather than being spelled again, so the rail's
 * row and this page cannot end up calling one destination two things.
 *
 * The screen is a client component throughout: the dates it prints are read from the
 * reader's clock, and the filters and paging are all interaction. There is no backend
 * behind it — `lib/employee/cases.ts` says exactly what the data is and is not.
 *
 * The Suspense boundary is required: the screen reads `?priority=` with
 * `useSearchParams()`, and without a boundary `next build` refuses to prerender the page.
